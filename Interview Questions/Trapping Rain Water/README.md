Trapping Rain Water


Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

Input: arr[]   = {3, 0, 2, 0, 4}
Output: 7

Explanation:
We can trap "3 units" of water between 3 and 2,
"1 unit" on top of bar 2 and "3 units" between 2 
and 4.
