Q. Java Program to Find if a Given Year is a Leap Year.


Leap Year contains 366 days, which comes once every four years. Every leap year corresponds to these facts : 

#A century year is a year ending with 00. A century year is a leap year only if it is divisible by 400.
#A leap year (except a century year) can be identified if it is exactly divisible by 4.
#A century year should be divisible by 4 and 100 both.
#A non-century year should be divisible only by 4.


Ex.
INPUT:  2000
OUTPUT: 2000 : Leap-year
LOGIC:	2000 is a century year divisible by 100 and 4.
INPUT:	2002
OUTPUT: 2002 : Non Leap-year
LOGIC:  2002 is not divisible by 4, therefore not a leap year.
